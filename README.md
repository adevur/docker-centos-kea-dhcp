# centos-kea-dhcp
This docker image provides a modern DHCPv4 server based on `ISC Kea Server`.

`ISC Kea` can be considered as a modern alternative to the old `ISC DHCP Server` (also known as `dhcpd`).

This docker image is based on CentOS 7.

`ISC Kea` version: `1.5.0`.

Available tags for this docker image: `latest`.

> NOTE: since there is no official `ISC Kea` package for CentOS 7, this docker image uses a version of `ISC Kea` compiled
from source by the same maintainer of this docker image. If you want to compile `ISC Kea` by yourself, you can take a look
at the `building` chapter.
